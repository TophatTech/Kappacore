# Kappacore
Arduino Based Digital Pet

------

Introducing the Kappacore, a project that recreates some of the popular digital pet handhelds from back in the late 1990's and early 2000's. With the low costs of color LCD screens, I wanted to create my own color digital pet and the code is open for the public to use.

I'll be building an actual handheld, and anyone will be able to find the files for Eagle as well as the board and schematic images at https://tophat.tech/blog

Once the code is written to a workable state I'll update the readme with full installation instructions, requirements, and other details.
